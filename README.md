## Executive Summary
<!-- 24% | Summarise the application answering all or some the following questions. What does the application do? Is there a story? Is it based on any ideas or in reference to anything? Does it aim to solve any problems? Does it look at difficult subjects? What’s good about it? Why is this project the one you decided to do? Is it something of special interest to you? -->

### Mission Statement
Make a fun, feline-inspired game that juggles platforming with searching for and combining items in order to achieve objectives.

### High Concept

Experience platforming and scaling objects from a brand new, tiny, furry perspective. Explore as a kitten while finding items to interact and play with. Combine different items to learn recipes for warp tunnels through the cat dimension, allowing quick travel to new locations while on the eternal hunt for more treats. Whether it’s by kneading on some nice comfy blankets, jumping in boxes, scratching on posts, knocking things off shelves or somehow appearing in a weird location, those treats will be found and eaten, just don't get caught!
A game for cat lovers, explorers, platformers and puzzlers to come together all in one. Avaliable on Windows.

### Unique Selling Points

- Viewing the world from a kittens perspective

- Jumping and manoeuvring around as a kitten

- Interating with items as a kitten

- Finding different combinations of items to interact with

- Warping from one place to another, accidentally or on purpose

- Achieving either game-given or user-driven goals

## Gameplay Overview
<!-- 28% | All rules and/or functionality are outlined. It’s clear what the application does, and what the user will do. The sum of all the rules / functionality makes a clear outline for the 6 weeks’ worth of work. -->

### Core Functionality / Mechanisms
Act like a kitten to find and obtain the treats.

- Walk forward, backward, left, and right in a 3D space (WASD/Arrows)
- Sprint forward, backward, left, and right in a 3D space (WASD/Arrows while holding Shift)
- Look left, right, up, and down in a separate way to moving around (Mouse)
- Jump to heights depending on where user is looking (Space + crosshair_location)
- Climb on certain objects such as trees, curtains, etc. by jumping onto them and moving (Space -> WASD)
- Interact with items on a button click (E)
- Pick up certain items, only one item at a time (Q)
- Combine interacting with 2 different items to activate a warp tunnel (E on each item)
- Warp from one location to another (F)
- Meow on the click of a button (left_mouse)
- Purr on the click of a button (right_mouse)
- Save Progress (Autosave and in the Esc Menu)
- Show mind-map to help guage the level and where threats/treats may be (Tab) <!-- maybe the cat shuts its eyes and the game is still going when looking at this screen -->

## UI
<!-- 14% | Diagrams show necessary UI in rectangles and text without colour. It’s clear what UI is needed and how much on-screen real-estate will be required to show it. -->
As the main forcus of the game is to take inspiration from being a kitten exploring the world, the HUD and UI in general will be quite minimal.
The only constant on the screen will be a crosshair to assist the user in knowing where they are aiming for jumps and interacting with objects. Interaction cues will appear onscreen when the user is looking at an interactable item, the cues will be a small bubble with the interaction button icon/letter showing, it may be coloured to assist with knowing what type of interactable it is, i.e jump cue, pickup cue, interaction cue, etc. 
The UI will keep to soft colours to help keep a calm feeling about the game. It will be a little cat inspired but still quite basic and minimalist.
